Welcome!

I am Yan Jin, currently pursuing an M.S. in Biostatistics at Washington University in St. Louis.

My research interests include:

- Aging and longevity genomics
- Spatial transcriptomics
- Single-cell multi-omics
- Epigenomics & regulatory genomics
- Statistical & computational genomics

I apply statistical modeling, probabilistic inference, and computational genomics tools to study biological mechanisms and promote meaningful biological discoveries.

🔬 **Research Interests**

- Statistical Genetics & Genomics
- Spatial transcriptomics / scRNA-seq
- Multi-omics integration
- EM algorithms & mixture models
- High-dimensional data analysis

📂 **Selected Projects**

**EM Algorithm for Genotype Frequency Estimation**  
A custom R implementation of an EM algorithm estimating MAF under Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium assumptions.  
➡ See code in: `_portfolio/em_algorithm.R`

(More projects will be added soon.)

📄 **CV**  
My latest CV is available in the CV tab on the navigation bar.
