# Welcome!

I am **Yan Jin**, currently pursuing an **M.S. in Biostatistics** at **Washington University in St. Louis**.  
My research interests focus on:

- Aging and longevity genomics  
- Spatial transcriptomics  
- Single-cell multi-omics  
- Epigenomics & regulatory genomics  
- Statistical and computational genomics  

I am passionate about using **statistical modeling**, **probabilistic inference**, and **computational tools** to understand biological mechanisms and improve biological discoveries.
